# Mockups for RbMU Flow site

These mockups were generated by Nanoc, a static site generator

Using blueprintcss stylesheets + BP-Vertical-Positioning plugin (see content/styles)

And slim templating language (see layouts)

## To view the mocks

1. `gem install adsf`
2. Go to root directory
3. `cd output && adsf` to start the web server
4. Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/mock-home.html, etc.

## If you don't want to boot up a web server

You can simply view the mocks standalone by opening the html files under output in your browser.
